# Teleport - Instant SMS 2FA
![macOS Supported Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires_macOS-13.0%2B-162734?style=flat-square)
![Release Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release%20Stage-Beta-162734?style=flat-square)

Teleport is a macOS utility that monitors incoming texts and automatically copies any authentication codes it finds to your clipboard.

> **Note** SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA)is no longer considered to be a secure option for two-factor authentication, and should only be used when there are no other 2FA options available. Whenever possible, it's best to use time-based one-time password (TOTP) options such as those provided by 1Password or Google Authenticator.

## Contributions

Contributions are very welcome! I am by no means a developer and started Teleport as a way to learn some Swift, any recommendations around features and best practices would be greatly appreciated.
